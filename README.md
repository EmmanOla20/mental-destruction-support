# mental-destruction-support
Mental Destruction Support is a free, open-access web space I built to help anyone dismantle fear, insecurity, and limiting beliefs — and rebuild mental resilience.  I’m not sure if similar sites already exist, but this project came from my own need for raw reminders that growth starts inside, not from perfection outside.
