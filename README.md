# 🌱 Mental Destruction Support

**Mental Destruction Support** is a free, open-access web space I built to help anyone dismantle fear, insecurity, and limiting beliefs — and rebuild mental resilience.

I'm not sure if similar sites already exist, but this project came from my own need for raw reminders that growth starts inside, not from perfection outside.

The site is intentionally simple:
- No sign-ups, no distractions
- Focused sections on weaponizing fear, trusting small wins, reframing failure, and building presence over appearance

## 🎯 Purpose
- Encourage everyday mental resilience, especially for those struggling with self-doubt and social pressure
- Show that even a basic HTML/CSS project can carry real meaning
- Inspire others to build open, accessible tools — because every voice matters, even if it’s not the first of its kind

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Hosted freely on GitHub Pages
